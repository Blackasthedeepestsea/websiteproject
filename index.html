        <div><img id="heroo" src="assets/img/opie.jpg">
            <p> Opie Ortiz is an American artist from Long Beach, California specializing in tattoos, pop art and murals. He's best known for his work with the band Sublime.</p>
        </div>
        <p>'He’s been following this road since discovering the remains of the city’s famous Pike amusement park (once home to seven tattoo parlors) as a kid.</p>
        <p>“I remember going down there and just being terrified. I was like 6 or 7 years old. Just riding my bike down there and creepy-crawlies just coming out,” he says. “All these weird people. Parts of it were still functioning: the military, the drugs, the hookers. It was probably the greatest place ever.” A few years later, he ventured into Bert Grimm’s shop—now, Kari Barba’s Outer Limits—the oldest tattoo parlor in the U.S. “I think I was 15 when I started hanging out there. I had one tattoo,” he says, struggling to find it in his full sleeves. “To me, it was like a church, going to church.”'</p>
